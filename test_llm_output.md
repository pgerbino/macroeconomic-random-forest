The following is the output from GPT looking athte betas between the intercept and inflation:

With detrended GDP growth in this analysis, we can focus more precisely on the relative influence of inflation and intercept betas on GDP growth fluctuations, independent of long-term growth trends:

    Sensitivity to Inflation Over Time: With GDP growth detrended, inflation betas offer a clearer view of the short-term relationship between inflationary movements and deviations from expected growth. Pre-COVID, these betas show variability, indicating changing short-term sensitivity to inflation. Lower or negative inflation betas during certain periods may imply that GDP growth deviations respond inversely to inflation, while positive inflation betas could indicate short-term procyclicality.

    COVID-19 Period and Immediate Response: Detrending highlights how intercept and inflation betas shifted markedly during the pandemic. The sharp increase in intercept betas reflects the effect of economic interventions and fiscal stimuli aimed at buffering GDP from expected negative deviations, essentially propping up short-term GDP responses. Volatility in inflation betas during this period, including both spikes and dips, underscores inflation's fluctuating impact on GDP in response to disrupted supply chains, sudden demand shifts, and inflationary pressures from policy and market responses to the pandemic.

    Post-COVID Dynamics and Resilience: Post-COVID, intercept betas have remained relatively high while inflation betas have moderated. This configuration suggests that while baseline GDP growth deviations remain robust, the response to inflation is more subdued. This may indicate an economic environment where detrended GDP deviations are less influenced by inflation and potentially more by other structural factors or internal economic adjustments post-pandemic.

    Long-Term Patterns with Detrending:
        Inflation Beta Shifts Reflect External Shocks and Adjustments: The shifts in inflation betas around significant events (like COVID-19) reveal how short-term GDP responses adjust to shocks, showing greater variability in response to inflation when external pressures (e.g., policy changes, supply chain issues) dominate.
        Sustained Intercept Beta Levels Post-COVID: Elevated intercept betas post-COVID might suggest structural adaptations or resilience mechanisms that dampen short-term fluctuations in GDP, even in a detrended context.

Overall, detrended GDP growth alongside time-varying betas highlights how the economy's short-term responsiveness to inflation and baseline factors has evolved, particularly through structural shocks like COVID-19.
